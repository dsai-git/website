                    <p>Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming ever more popular for data. Our
                        Introduction to Python focuses on Python for data science. You will learn basic programming
                        skills using Python, including data handling, variables types, operations and functions.</p>
                    <p>Maryam Montazer specialises in applied machine learning and statistical modelling. She has
                        diverse experience spanning industrial and academic projects such as public health management,
                        agriculture and dairy production, climate modelling, spatiotemporal data modelling and
                        visualisation, wind generators and renewable energy integration, image and signal processing,
                        time series analysis, bioinformatics, real estate and house price modelling, transport
                        management, customer service and customer engagement.</p>
                    <p>You will learn the basics of Python programming and will start coding after few hours training.
                        Training materials will be provided which can be a useful reference for your future uses.</p>

                    <p>How to get into the field of data science ? A question asked by too many aspiring data
                        scientists. This
                        introductory level study group, following the book ‘Think Stats’ will teach you not only the
                        basic
                        statistical concepts and tools but also how to think like a data scientist. You will also learn
                        how Python
                        is used for data manipulation and analysis, in a structured fashion.</p>
                    <p>So join us every Thursday 6 PM to 8 PM starting 1st August for a 6 week course that DSAi has
                        organised
                        for anyone looking for entry into the wonderful world of data science. This is a rare
                        opportunity to learn
                        from industry experts and build a network within the community, an absolute essential for any
                        aspiring
                        data scientist. Its also absolutely free.</p>
                    <p>Please enrol in this study group by completing the Google Form below. We will notify you by email
                        if you
                        are accepted to take part in the group.</p>

                    <p class="event-date">Length: 5 weeks</p>
                    <p class="event-date">Date: 17th April, 24th April, 1st May, 9th May, 15th May</p>
                    <p class="event-venue">Venue: Microsoft Reactor | 10/11 York St, Sydney NSW 2000</p>

                    <p>Bayesian Statistics is getting quite popular today, but Bayesian Inference is the way
                        scientists did
                        statistics before the 20th century. All our intuition about things like p-values and
                        confidence intervals
                        actually matches the Bayesian equivalents and not the actual definitions. However, the
                        chance to study
                        Bayesian Inference is quite fleeting and so there are many misconceptions and a general lack
                        of knowledge
                        on the how and the advantages inherent to such an approach.</p>
                    <p>To help with this, DSAi will be running a study group, going through Richard McElreath’s
                        fantastic
                        course, “Statistical Rethinking” in which build up an alternate Bayesian view of data,
                        statistics and
                        inference and question our existing assumptions and standard procedures.</p>
