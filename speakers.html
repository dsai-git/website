                <p>The efficient and safe mobility of people and goods in urban areas is a challenging problem that
                    becomes more difficult with increasing population density. Congestion, accidents and pollution are
                    highly undesirable for the financial, environmental and general well-being of the population. The
                    automation of vehicles has long been considered part of a “smart cities” solution to this problem,
                    working towards a utopian, sci-fi vision of the future. These technologies have been long promised,
                    but seem to be always just out of reach. This presentation will highlight some of the key challenges
                    in vehicle automation. The application of machine learning as a “black box” approach does not easily
                    fit with a highly safety critical engineered system. The talk focused particularly on aspects of
                    autonomous systems that are appropriate for deep learning, but also where these techniques are not
                    appropriate given our current understanding of the problem & what ML techniques might be applied to
                    address these issues.</p>

                <p>Over the last few years, deep learning techniques for image based semantic segmentation have been
                    demonstrated to produce remarkable results for applications in intelligent transportation systems.
                    However, the issue of the robustness has recently been recognised as a major challenge for the
                    massive deployment of this new technology. In particular, for autonomous vehicles, any erroneous
                    classification could potentially lead to catastrophic consequences. In this talk, Wei explained the
                    main challenges we are facing at the moment when applying semantic segmentation to autonomous
                    vehicles. Wei presented her proposed method to validate the robustness of semantic segmentation by
                    automatically generating ground-truth labels. This method can be used in most real-world driving
                    scenarios without the time and expense of using humans to generate labels by hand.</p>

                        <p>Machine learning has had many recent successes, but current popular methods have their
                            limitations, including requiring many training examples and a lack of transparency.
                            Classical AI techniques can help to learn from a small number of examples and make the
                            result more explainable. In particular, classical AI has well-developed methods for
                            representing and reasoning about background domain knowledge. In this talk, Professor Claude
                            Sammut described the hybrid learning methods they have used in robot learning that combine
                            symbolic learning and planning with numerical methods. Examples of such robot learning
                            systems include learning a bipedal walk, a robot learning to use tools and a rescue robot
                            learning to traverse rough terrain.</p>
