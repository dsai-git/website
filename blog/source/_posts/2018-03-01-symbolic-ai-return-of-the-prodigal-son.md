# Symbolic AI, return of the prodigal son

**What is Symbolic AI ?** 

We humans, represent the world around us through high level concepts. For example, the word 'Man', it stands for something, in this case a biological entity that has certain properties. 'Trees' , 'Flowers', 'Skyscrapers' are just words (symbols) that stand for something or someone. It might sound like I am explaining the trivial, however, it is important to grok this idea to understand the essence of Symbolic AI. Now, lets analyze this statement that dates back to ancient Rome, "All men are mortal;  Caius is a man; therefore Caius is mortal. " Here we associated mortality with all men, thus deducing Caius is also mortal,since he is a man. This is the essence of symbolic AI, reasoning through relationships among high level concepts. But its quite labor intensive, a human has to encode these high level concepts and their relationship into rules.
